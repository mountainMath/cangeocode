## `R/geocode.R` — the forward query layer

`geocode()` parses with `normalize_address()` and then runs the tiers named in **`method`**,
**in the order given** — that order *is* the priority, since each tier is offered only the
rows its predecessors left without a position. `match_method` reports which one answered and
`uncertainty_m` what that method costs. On the 5,000 Corporations Canada addresses the eval
draws, the exact tier places 84.9% and interpolation lifts that to **89.1%**, in 0.9s for
the whole batch.

The vocabulary is `"nar"` (exact lookup), `"nar_interpolate"`, and `"bc"`, defaulting to
`c("nar", "nar_interpolate")` — the offline pair. **`method` replaced the earlier `source`,
`interpolate` and `fallback` arguments**, which were three ways of saying the same thing and
could not express an ordering. `nar_geocode_methods()` validates it; exact matches beat
prefixes in `pmatch()`, so `"nar"` is unambiguous against `"nar_interpolate"`.

**"Unplaced" is `is.na(out$x)`, not `match_method == "none"`.** That single definition is
what sends a `nar_no_geometry` row on to the next tier — NAR holds the record but no
coordinates, and withholding a position its neighbours can supply would be perverse — while
the `ADDR_GUID` the exact tier found survives whichever tier ends up placing it. The reverse
is a real cost and is documented: a tier that never runs reports nothing, so putting `"nar"`
last leaves interpolated rows with no `ADDR_GUID`.

| `match_method` | meaning | `uncertainty_m` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nar_building` | the civic number is in NAR with its own building point | 0 |
| `nar_blockface` | in NAR, but only a blockface centroid | 176 |
| `nar_interpolated` | not in NAR; placed between the flanking civics | `0.5 * span` |
| `nar_no_geometry` | in NAR (`ADDR_GUID` is set) but unplaceable | `NA` |
| `not_covered` | parsed to a province this (partial) database does not hold | `NA` |
| `none` | not found | `NA` |

`uncertainty_m` is defined as the **90th-percentile error this package adds relative to
NAR's own building point**, and deliberately says nothing about NAR's own error, which is
neither published nor consistent — the User Guide admits a building point may be the
driveway. So `0` means "this package added nothing", not "this point is exact". The two
non-zero figures are measured: 176 m is the p90 building→blockface separation over the
1.85M addresses carrying both (p50 50, p95 332), and the interpolation figure comes from
the error/span ratio being **scale-invariant** — its p90 is 0.50 in every span bucket from
under 50 m to over 2 km (0.496–0.522), so half the flanking span is the p90 error whatever
the scale.

**Extrapolation is refused rather than flagged.** Past the last known civic on a side there
is no second point, and continuing the run's spacing scores a 15.1 m median but a 237 m p90
— barely better than the nearest neighbour it would displace. 7.3% of NAR civics sit at the
end of a run. Interpolation is same-parity only (4.2 m median against 35.2 m pooling both
sides, and 16.9 m for nearest-known-civic), and takes only `geom_source = 'building'` flanks,
since compounding a 176 m blockface error at each end would be presented as precision.

`prov`, `mun` and `within` are **authoritative** — they override whatever the address string
said, and the override lands on the returned row too, so a result never reports a province
next to a point constrained to a different one. `mun` goes through `MunAlias` rather than
straight at `MAIL_MUN_NAME`, because it is a name a person typed: constraining to `TORONTO`
by mailing city would drop everything NAR files under `SCARBOROUGH`. The parsed municipality
keeps the direct comparison, the gazetteer having already turned it into NAR's own string.
`within` densifies its outline **with the CRS temporarily unset** before reprojecting —
`st_segmentize()` on a geographic geometry needs `lwgeom`, which is not a dependency, and
planar interpolation is what is wanted anyway.

**The one performance trap, and it is a 99x one.** Both name families must be matched, and
writing that as `OFFICIAL = x OR MAIL = x` leaves the join with no equijoin key, so DuckDB
nested-loops the 17.4M-row table: the interpolation tier took **15.87s** that way against
**0.16s** as a `UNION` of two single-column equijoins, for byte-identical results. The exact
tier hid it, `CIVIC_NO = p.civic` having handed the planner a hash key of its own. That is
why `nar_geocode_candidates()` exists and why both tiers go through it. Otherwise no index
is needed: the folded street-key join costs 0.05s for a 5-row probe and 0.08s for a 200-row
one, so **batch into one call rather than looping**.

Street type and direction are compared through `upper()` on the NAR side. NAR stores
`OFFICIAL_STREET_NAME` Mixed Case against the `MAIL_*` family's UPPERCASE, and the gazetteer
hands back the `OFFICIAL_*` spelling — without the fold, `24 Sussex Dr, Ottawa` matches nothing.
(The type and direction columns are uppercase in both families, so the fold is redundant there
and kept for uniformity.)

Coordinates are built in `sf` from the returned `x`/`y` rather than through `collect_nar()`,
because these are freshly computed values rather than a stored geometry column; the storage
CRS is still read from the database with `nar_crs()`, and `sf` handles the axis order that
`collect_nar()` needs `always_xy` for.

## `R/geocode_bc.R` — the one external geocoder

A binding to the Province of British Columbia's [Address Geocoder]. `bc_geocode()` is the
client, `nar_geocode_tier_bc()` is the `"bc"` tier `method` can name, and `bc_validate()`
compares an existing result against BC's answer in metres. BC only: asked about an Ontario
address the service answers with whatever BC place shares the name, so the tier filters on
`PROV_ABVN == "BC"` before sending anything.

**The service always answers, so a response is not a match.**
`1234 Nonexistentzzz Rd, Victoria, BC` comes back as the centre of Victoria with a score of
48 — a point, not an error. Two independent floors decide: `nar_bc_precision()` maps
`matchPrecision` onto a `bc_*` method, and `min_score` (default 60) rejects what the service
itself scored badly. A rejected row keeps its `bc_score` and `bc_faults` and loses only its
`uncertainty_m`, so what was thrown away stays readable.

**The `bc_*` uncertainty figures are the only numbers in this package that were not
measured.** BC publishes `locationPositionalAccuracy` as the categorical
`high`/`medium`/`low`/`coarse` and no distance at all, so `nar_bc_precision()` translates its
precision vocabulary into deliberately pessimistic order-of-magnitude metres. Treat them as a
ranking safe to filter on, not as an error bar comparable to the NAR tiers'. Calibrating them
is named as the next step in the note.

**The tier rebuilds the query string from the components rather than forwarding `input`.** `prov`/`mun` are authoritative and overwrite the parsed columns, so forwarding the
original string would silently discard the caller's constraint the moment a row fell through.
`within` is enforced too, in R — the SQL predicate cannot reach a point that came from another
service, so a fallback point outside the bounds is discarded rather than returned.

**Throttling needs `capacity`, not `rate`.** `httr2::req_throttle(rate = 5)` builds a
`5 * 60 = 300`-token bucket and lets the first 300 requests go at once. `capacity = rate,
fill_time_s = 1` is the actual cap, with the realm named explicitly so a URL-derived realm
cannot give every address its own pool.

`httr2` is in `Suggests` and nothing reaches the network unless one of these functions is
called. The tests run entirely against responses captured from the live service into
`tests/testthat/fixtures/bc-*.json`, which is also the only way the parser stays checkable
once BC changes its scoring; `nar_bc_feature()` takes parsed JSON rather than a response
object precisely so that is possible.
